            <strong>
            <p>Did you know that coffee is actually part of a family of flowering plants called Rubiaceae? <br> Within this family, you will find over five hundred General (the biological group that a family is divided into) and about six thousand species.

            <p>One of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)! Although botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee plants, <br> of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)! Although
                botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee plants, <br> the coffees we drink fall mainly within just two species.Arabica and Canephora, also known as Robusta. This brings us to the difference between Arabica
                beans vs Robusta beans.</p>

            <h2> Arabica beans vs Robusta beans
            </h2>
            <i><p>Arabica has two main varieties, Typica and Bourbon. In Canephora, we drink the variety called Robusta. <br> This is why the term Robusta is generally used for this entire variety of coffee. In effect, coffee beans <br> have been divided into two main types. Arabica and Robusta. The main difference, besides being <br> different species of the same plant family, comes down to flavour and characteristics of the actual bean.</p>

            <h3>Same family, different characteristics</h3><br>
            <i>
            <p>Keep in mind, that even a single type of bean or variety can vary in quality and flavour. Often <br> unpredictable growing conditions and process methods will produce a varying flavour profile in the <br> resulting cup. A successfully grown coffee
                bean exhibits a completely distinct set of characteristics <br> when grown in one location as compared to another. <br> One prime example of this would be the coffee named Kona. While the bean itself is the Arabica variety, <br>these beans
                are grown only in Kona, a district of Big Island in Hawaii. The specific environmental conditions of Kona gives the beans their unique <br>qualities not exhibited when grown elsewhere. The same would be true for Arabica beans vs Robusta beans.
                There can be a wide difference in flavour <br> and quality due to growing conditions and terroir.</p>

            <h4>ARABICA COFFEE BEANS</h4>
            <br>
            <i><p>Despite containing less caffeine than Robusta, Arabica beans are often considered superior in taste. Arabica tends to have a smoother, <br> sweeter taste, with flavour notes of chocolate and sugar. They often also have hints of fruits or berries. <br> Robusta, on the other hand, has a stronger, harsher and more bitter taste, with grainy or rubbery overtones.</p>

            <i>
            <p>According to the International Coffee Organisation, more than 60 per cent of world coffee production comes from Arabica cultivators. <br> This was the type of bean that started off the whole coffee story in Ethiopia, and it still grows best in
                    higher elevations. <br> Glorious in smell, Arabica flowers appear only after a couple of years and produce ellipsoidal fruits, inside which are two flat seeds known as the coffee beans.</p>

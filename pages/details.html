    <h1>
        THE BEAN IDENTITY
    </h1>
    <br>
    <strong>
    <p>Did you know that coffee is actually part of a family of flowering plants called Rubiaceae? <br> Within this family, you will find over five hundred General (the biological group that a family is divided into) and about six thousand species.
    </p>
    </strong>
    <i><p>One of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)! Although botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee plants, <br> of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)! Although
    botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee plants, <br> the coffees we drink fall mainly within just two species.Arabica and Canephora, also known as Robusta. This brings us to the difference between Arabica beans vs Robusta beans.</p></i>
    <br>
    <h2> Arabica beans vs Robusta beans
    </h2>
    <i><p>Arabica has two main varieties, Typica and Bourbon. In Canephora, we drink the variety called Robusta. <br> This is why the term Robusta is generally used for this entire variety of coffee. In effect, coffee beans <br> have been divided into two main types. Arabica and Robusta. The main difference, besides being <br> different species of the same plant family, comes down to flavour and characteristics of the actual bean.</p>
    </i>
    <br>
    <h3>Same family, different characteristics</h3><br>
    <i>
        <p>Keep in mind, that even a single type of bean or variety can vary in quality and flavour. Often <br> unpredictable growing conditions and process methods will produce a varying flavour profile in the <br> resulting cup. A successfully grown coffee
            bean exhibits a completely distinct set of characteristics <br> when grown in one location as compared to another. <br> One prime example of this would be the coffee named Kona. While the bean itself is the Arabica variety, <br>these beans
            are grown only in Kona, a district of Big Island in Hawaii. The specific environmental conditions of Kona gives the beans their unique <br>qualities not exhibited when grown elsewhere. The same would be true for Arabica beans vs Robusta beans.
            There can be a wide difference in flavour <br> and quality due to growing conditions and terroir.</p></i>
    <br>

    <h4>ARABICA COFFEE BEANS</h4> <br>
    <i><p>Despite containing less caffeine than Robusta, Arabica beans are often considered superior in taste. Arabica tends to have a smoother, <br> sweeter taste, with flavour notes of chocolate and sugar. They often also have hints of fruits or berries. <br> Robusta, on the other hand, has a stronger, harsher and more bitter taste, with grainy or rubbery overtones.</p></i>
    <br>
    <i>
    <p>According to the International Coffee Organisation, more than 60 per cent of world coffee production comes from Arabica cultivators. <br> This was the type of bean that started off the whole coffee story in Ethiopia, and it still grows best in higher
        elevations. <br> Glorious in smell, Arabica flowers appear only after a couple of years and produce ellipsoidal fruits, inside which are two flat seeds known as the coffee beans.</p>
    </i>
    <i><p>An Arabica shrub grows up to 15 feet (5m) tall but is usually pruned to about 6 feet (2m) to make it more commercially viable. <br> Arabica has two sets of chromosomes, so it is capable of self-pollination. This means that it remains generally stable as a species <br> because cross-pollination is less probable.

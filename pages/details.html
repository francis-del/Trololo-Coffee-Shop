	<h1 id="ourPride">THE BEAN IDENTITY</h1>
	<strong>
		<p>Did you know that coffee is actually part of a family of flowering plants
			called
			Rubiaceae? <br> Within this family, you will find over five hundred General
			(the
			biological group that a family is divided into) and about six thousand
			species.
		</p>
	</strong>
	<p class="mb-30">
		<i>
			One of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)!
			Although
			botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee
			plants,
			<br> of these is the bean we love, coffee (Coffea in scientific terms)!
			Although
			botanists regard all seed-bearing plants in the Rubiaceae family as coffee
			plants,
			<br> the coffees we drink fall mainly within just two species.Arabica and
			Canephora,
			also known as Robusta. This brings us to the difference between Arabica beans
			vs
			Robusta beans.
		</i>
	</p>

	<h2 id="differences"> Arabica beans vs Robusta beans</h2>
	<p class="mb-30">
		<i>
			Arabica has two main varieties, Typica and Bourbon. In Canephora, we drink the
			variety called Robusta. <br> This is why the term Robusta is generally used
			for
			this
			entire variety of coffee. In effect, coffee beans <br> have been divided into
			two
			main
			types. Arabica and Robusta. The main difference, besides being <br> different
			species
			of the same plant family, comes down to flavour and characteristics of the
			actual
			bean.
		</i>
	</p>

	<h2 id="kona">Same family, different characteristics</h2>
	<p class="mb-30">
		<i>
			Keep in mind, that even a single type of bean or variety can vary in quality
			and
			flavour. Often <br> unpredictable growing conditions and process methods will
			produce a varying flavour profile in the <br> resulting cup. A successfully
			grown
			coffee
			bean exhibits a completely distinct set of characteristics <br> when grown in
			one
			location as compared to another. <br> One prime example of this would be the
			coffee named Kona. While the bean itself is the Arabica variety, <br>these
			beans
			are grown only in Kona, a district of Big Island in Hawaii. The specific
			environmental conditions of Kona gives the beans their unique <br>qualities
			not
			exhibited when grown elsewhere. The same would be true for Arabica beans vs
			Robusta beans.
			There can be a wide difference in flavour <br> and quality due to growing
			conditions and terroir.
		</i>
	</p>

	<h2  id="arabica">Arabica coffee beans</h2>
	<p class="mb-30">
		<i>
			Despite containing less caffeine than Robusta, Arabica beans are often
			considered
			superior in taste. Arabica tends to have a smoother, <br> sweeter taste, with
			flavour
			notes of chocolate and sugar. They often also have hints of fruits or berries.
			<br>
			Robusta, on the other hand, has a stronger, harsher and more bitter taste,
			with
			grainy
			or rubbery overtones.
		</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>
			According to the International Coffee Organisation, more than 60 per cent of
			world
			coffee production comes from Arabica cultivators. <br> This was the type of
			bean
			that started off the whole coffee story in Ethiopia, and it still grows best
			in
			higher
			elevations. <br> Glorious in smell, Arabica flowers appear only after a couple
			of
			years and produce ellipsoidal fruits, inside which are two flat seeds known as
			the
			coffee beans.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>
			An Arabica shrub grows up to 15 feet (5m) tall but is usually pruned to about
			6
			feet
			(2m) to make it more commercially viable. <br> Arabica has two sets of
			chromosomes, so
			it is capable of self-pollination. This means that it remains generally stable
			as
			a
			species <br> because cross-pollination is less probable.
